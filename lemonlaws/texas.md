## Texas Lemon Law General Warranty Complaints

Section 3.08(i).

- The owner of a motor vehicle or the owner's designated agent may make a complaint concerning defects in a motor vehicle which are covered by a manufacturer's, converter's, or distributor's warranty agreement applicable to the vehicle. Any such complaint must be made in writing to the applicable dealer, manufacturer, converter, or distributor and must specify the defects in the vehicle which are covered by the warranty. The owner may also invoke the Commission's jurisdiction by sending the Commission a copy of the complaint. A hearing may be scheduled on all complaints arising under this subsection which are not privately resolved between the owner and the dealer, manufacturer, converter, or distributor.


# Texas Lemon Law Warranty Performance Obligations

Section 6.07.

- In addition to the other powers and duties provided for in this Act, the Commission shall cause manufacturers, converters, and distributors to perform the obligations imposed by this section. For purposes of this section, the term "owner" means a retail purchaser, lessor, lessee other than a sublessee, or the person so designated on the certificate of title to a motor vehicle issued by the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation, or an equivalent document issued by the duly authorized agency of any other state, or any person to whom such motor vehicle is legally transferred during the duration of a manufacturer's or distributor's express warranty applicable to such motor vehicle, and any other person entitled by the terms of the manufacturer's, converter's, or distributor's express warranty to enforce the obligations thereof.

- If a new motor vehicle does not conform to all applicable manufacturer's, converter's, or distributor's express warranties, the manufacturer, converter, or distributor shall make the repairs necessary to conform the vehicle to the applicable express warranties, notwithstanding that the repairs are made after the expiration of the warranties, if: 

    - the owner or the owner's designated agent reported the nonconformity to the manufacturer,converter, or distributor, its agent, or its franchised dealer during the term of such express warranties; or

    - a rebuttable presumption relating to the vehicle was created under Subsection (d) of this section. This section does not in any way limit the remedies available to an owner under a new motor vehicle warranty that extends beyond the provisions of this section.

- If the manufacturer, converter, or distributor is unable to conform the motor vehicle to an applicable express warranty by repairing or correcting any defect or condition which creates a serious safety hazard or substantially impairs the use or market value of the motor vehicle after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer, converter, or distributor shall

    - replace the motor vehicle with a comparable motor vehicle; or
    
    - accept return of the vehicle from the owner and refund to the owner the full purchase price less a reasonable allowance for the owner's use of the vehicle and any other allowances or refunds payable to the owner.

- In this section, "impairment of market value" means a substantial loss in market value caused by a defect specific to the vehicle. In addition to replacing the vehicle or refunding the purchase price, the manufacturer, converter, or distributor shall reimburse the owner for reasonable incidental costs resulting from loss of use of the motor vehicle because of the nonconformity or defect. As necessary to promote the public interest, the Commission by rule shall define the incidental costs that are eligible for reimbursement, shall specify other requirements necessary to determine an eligible cost, and may set a maximum amount that is eligible for reimbursement, either by type of eligible cost or a total for all costs. Refunds shall be made to the owner and lienholder, if any, as their interests may appear. A reasonable allowance for use shall be that amount directly attributable to use of the motor vehicle when the vehicle is not out of service for repair. An order to refund or to replace may not be issued by the Executive Director against a manufacturer, converter, or distributor unless the manufacturer, converter, or distributor has been mailed prior written notification of the alleged nonconformity or defect from or on behalf of the owner and has been given an opportunity to cure the alleged defect or nonconformity. In any hearing before the Executive Director under this section, a manufacturer, converter, or distributor may plead and prove as an affirmative defense to the remedies provided hereunder that

    - the nonconformity is the result of abuse, neglect, or unauthorized modifications or alterations of the motor vehicle; or

    - the nonconformity does not substantially impair the use or market value of the motor vehicle. In this section, "serious safety hazard" means a life-threatening malfunction or nonconformity that substantially impedes a person's ability to control or operate a motor vehicle for ordinary use or intended purposes or that creates a substantial risk of fire or explosion.

- There is a rebuttable presumption that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform a motor vehicle to the applicable express warranties if 

    - the same nonconformity has been subject to repair four or more times by the manufacturer, converter,or distributor, its agent, or its franchised dealer and two of the repair attempts have been made within a period of 12 months following the date of original delivery to an owner, or 12,000 miles, whichever occurs first, and the other two repair attempts occur within the 12 months or 12,000 miles immediately following the date of the second repair attempt, whichever occurs first, but such nonconformity continues to exist;

    - the same nonconformity creates a serious safety hazard and has caused the vehicle to have been subject to repair two or more times by the manufacturer, converter, or distributor, or an authorized agent or franchised dealer, and at least one attempt to repair the nonconformity was made in the period of 12 months or 12,000 miles, whichever occurs first, and at least one other attempt made in the period of 12 months or 12,000 miles after the first repair attempt, whichever occurs first, but the nonconformity continues to exist; or

    - the vehicle is out of service for repair for a cumulative total of 30 or more days in the 24 months or 24,000 miles, whichever occurs first, and at least two repair attempts were made in the first 12 months or 12,000 miles immediately following the date of original delivery to an owner and a nonconformity still exists that substantially impairs the vehicle's use or market value. The initial 12-month period or 12,000 mile limit, the subsequent 12-month period or 12,000 mile limit, and the 30-day period shall be extended by any period of time during which repair services are not available to the owner because of a war, invasion, strike or fire, flood, or other natural disaster. During any period of time that the manufacturer or distributor lends a comparable motor vehicle to the owner during the time the vehicle is being repaired by a franchised dealer, the 30-day period provided for in this subsection is tolled.

- The Commission shall adopt rules for the enforcement and implementation of this section.

    - The Executive Director shall, in accordance with rules adopted by the Commission, conduct hearings and issue final orders for the enforcement and implementation of this section. Orders issued by the Executive Director under this section are considered final orders of the Commission.

    - Except as provided by Subdivision (6) of this subsection, the provisions of this section are not available to an owner in an action seeking a refund or replacement based upon the alleged nonconformity of a motor vehicle to an express warranty applicable to the motor vehicle unless the owner has first exhausted the administrative remedies provided herein.

    - The provisions of this section are not available to a party in an action against a seller under Chapter 2 or Chapter 17, Business & Commerce Code, as amended.

    - Except as provided by Subdivision (6) of this subsection, the provisions of this section are available in an action against a manufacturer, converter, or distributor brought under Chapter 17, Business & Commerce Code, after the owner has exhausted the administrative remedies provided by this section.

    - If, after a complaint has been filed under this section, the Hearing Examiner has not issued a proposal for decision and recommended to the Executive Director a final order before the expiration of the 150th day after the date the complaint was filed, the Executive Director shall, in writing sent by certified mail, so inform the complainant and the manufacturer, converter, or distributor of the expiration of the 150-day period and of the complainant's right to file a civil action. The Commission shall extend the 150-day period if a delay is requested or is caused by the complainant.

    - After receipt of the notice of the right to file a civil action, the complainant may file a civil action against one or more of the persons complained of in the complaint.

    - A failure by the Commission to issue a notice of the right to file a civil action does not affect a complainant's right to bring an action under this Act.
    
    - Any party to a proceeding under this section before the Executive Director that is affected by a final order of the Executive Director is entitled to judicial review of the order under the substantial evidence rule in a District Court of Travis County, Texas. The judicial review is subject to the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act (Article6252-13a, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes) except to the extent that that Act is inconsistent with this Act.

- This section does not limit the rights or remedies otherwise available to an owner under any other law.

- In a hearing under this section, the Executive Director shall make its order with respect to responsibility for payment of the cost of any refund or replacement and no manufacturer, converter, or distributor may cause any franchised dealer to pay directly or indirectly any sum not specifically so ordered by the Executive Director. If the Executive Director orders a manufacturer, converter, or distributor to refund or replace a motor vehicle because it meets the criteria set forth in this section, the Executive Director may order the franchised dealer to reimburse the owner, lienholder, manufacturer, converter, or distributor only for items or options added to the vehicle by the franchised dealer and only to the extent that one or more of such items or options contributed to the defect that served as the basis for the Executive Director's order of refund or replacement. In a case involving a leased vehicle,the Executive Director may terminate the lease and apportion the allowance for use and other allowances or refunds between the lessee and lessor of the vehicle.

- A proceeding brought under this section shall be commenced within six months following the earlier of 

    - expiration of the express warranty term or

    - 24 months or 24,000 miles following the date of original delivery of the motor vehicle to an owner.

- A contractual provision that excludes or modifies the remedies provided for in this section is prohibited and shall be deemed null and void as against public policy unless the exclusion or modification is done with respect to a settlement agreement between the owner and the manufacturer, converter, or distributor.

    - A manufacturer, distributor, or converter that has been ordered to repurchase or replace a vehicle shall, through its franchised dealer, issue a disclosure statement stating that the vehicle was repurchased or replaced by the manufacturer, distributor, or converter under this section. The disclosure statement must accompany the vehicle through the first retail purchase. The manufacturer, distributor, or converter must restore the cause of the repurchase or replacement to factory specifications and issue a new 12-month, 12,000-mile warranty on the vehicle. The disclosure statement must include a toll-free telephone number of the Commission that will enable a purchaser of a repurchased or replaced vehicle to obtain information about the condition or defect that was the basis of the order for repurchase or replacement. The Commission shall adopt rules for the enforcement of this subdivision.

    - The Commission shall provide a toll-free telephone number for providing information to persons who request information about a condition or defect that was the basis for repurchase or replacement by an order of the Executive Director. The Commission shall maintain an effective method of providing information to persons who make the requests.

- The Commission shall publish an annual report on the motor vehicles ordered repurchased or replaced under this section. The report must list the number of vehicles by brand name and model and include a brief description of the conditions or defects that caused the repurchase or replacement. The Commission shall make the report available to the public. The Commission may charge a reasonable fee to recover the cost of the report.

- Information filed with the Board under this section is not a public record and is not subject to release under the open records law, Chapter 552, Government Code, until the complaint is finally resolved by order of the Board.
