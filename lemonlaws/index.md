# Arizona Lemon Law- Arizona Motor Vehicle Warranties Act

<img src="/images/broke2.jpg" class="right">

Many people mistakenly think that when their new cars have repairs made under warranty for "free" there is no violation of the law. Arizona law says otherwise. Arizona law protects consumers whose car's use and value have been negatively affected by the car's defects. A buyer is entitled to Lemon Law protection when the number of repairs or time his or her car has been in the shop is unreasonable or untimely. It is presumed that a manufacturer has had a reasonable opportunity to repair a vehicle when there have been four or more repairs for the same issue, or if the vehicle has been out of service for 30 or more days as a result of repairs (regardless of whether the issue is the same). However, this is just a legal presumption added to help consumers, it is not a barrier; a consumer may still have a valid Lemon Law case even if the car does not have this number of repairs or time out of service. 

You may be entitled to a refund (minus a reasonable usage fee), replacement of the "Lemon," and to recover attorneys' fees from the car's manufacturer.  Pryor, Ramirez & Amar may also be able to negotiate a cash settlement in the alternative. These remedies and recoveries are available regardless of whether the repairs were "free" under the vehicle's warranty.
