**Georgia Lemon law 10-1-784**

- a)
  
  - If the manufacturer, its agent, or the new motor vehicle dealer is unable to repair or correct any nonconformity in a new motor vehicle after a reasonable number of attempts, the consumer shall notify the manufacturer by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the address provided by the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall, within seven days after receipt of such notification, notify the consumer of a reasonably accessible repair facility and after delivery of the vehicle to the designated repair facility by the consumer, the manufacturer shall, within 14 days, conform the motor vehicle to the warranty. If the manufacturer is unable to repair or correct any nonconformity of the new motor vehicle, the manufacturer shall, within 30 days of the consumer's written request, by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the option of the consumer, or the lessor in the event of a leased motor vehicle, replace or repurchase the new motor vehicle. If the manufacturer fails to notify the consumer of a reasonably accessible repair facility or perform the repairs within the time periods prescribed in this subsection, the requirement that the manufacturer be given a final attempt to cure the nonconformity does not apply.
  
  - If a lessor elects replacement, the contractual obligation, except for those terms of the agreement which identify the vehicle, between the lessor and the consumer shall not be altered. If a lessor elects repurchase, it shall return to the consumer a sum equal to the allowance for any trade-in, and down payment or initial balloon payment, made by the consumer, and all future obligations of the consumer to the lessor shall cease. In the event a lessor elects to require the manufacturer to repurchase a leased vehicle, the consumer will remain liable for all lease obligations arising prior to the date that the lessor elects such replacement, but will have no future obligations under the lease, and will be liable for no penalty for early termination. A lessor must elect either a repurchase or replacement within 30 days of receiving written notice from the consumer that such an election is desired; if the lessor fails to make such an election within the 30 days, the consumer may make the election to repurchase or replace and the lessor shall be bound by the consumer's election.
  
  - The replacement motor vehicle shall be identical or reasonably equivalent to the motor vehicle to be replaced. Such replacement shall include payment of all collateral charges which the consumer or lessor will incur a second time which would not have been incurred again except for the replacement, and any and all incidental costs incurred by the consumer or lessor. In the case of a replacement motor vehicle, the reasonable offset for use shall be paid by the consumer to the manufacturer. Compensation for a reasonable offset for use shall be paid by the consumer to the manufacturer in the event that a replacement motor vehicle is elected. In the case of a lease where the consumer either has no option to purchase the motor vehicle at the end of the lease term, or the consumer has an option to purchase the motor vehicle at the end of the lease term but does not exercise the option, the lessor shall refund to the consumer the lesser of (A) the offset for use paid by the consumer to the manufacturer at the time of delivery of the replacement vehicle, or (B) the gain realized by the lessor by reason of the difference, if any, between the anticipated residual value of the original motor vehicle as determined at the inception of the lease and the realized value of the replacement motor vehicle at the end of the lease. If the lessor does not realize any gain from the disposition of the replacement vehicle, there will be no refund due to the consumer from the lessor. The foregoing rules apply only to leases where the consumer performs all of the consumer's obligations under the lease agreement and the lease terminates upon the scheduled expiration of the lease term as set forth in the lease agreement or any mutually agreed upon extension of the lease term. The administrator may provide by rule under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," for determining the manner of calculating the amount of any further charges or refunds that may apply in the case of leases terminated prematurely either by the voluntary election of the parties, or involuntarily by the lessor in the event of the lessee's default, the loss or destruction of the vehicle, or for any other reason.
  
  - When repurchasing the new motor vehicle, the manufacturer shall refund to the consumer all collateral charges and incidental costs. In the event of a repurchase, purchase price refunds shall be made to the consumer and lienholder of record, if any, as his or her interests may appear, less a reasonable offset for use. In the event of a lease, purchase price refunds shall be made to the lessor, less a reasonable offset for use. If it is determined that the lessee is entitled to a refund, the consumer's lease agreement with the lessor shall be terminated upon payment of the refund and no penalty for early termination shall be assessed.

- b) A reasonable number of attempts shall be presumed as a matter of law to have been undertaken by the manufacturer, its agent, or the new motor vehicle dealer to repair or correct any nonconformity of a new motor vehicle, if: (1) a serious safety defect in the braking or steering system has been subject to repair at least once during the lemon law rights period and has not been corrected; (2) during any period of 24 months or less, or during any period in which the vehicle has been driven 24,000 miles or less, whichever occurs first, any other serious safety defect has been subject to repair two or more times, at least one of which is during the lemon law rights period, and the nonconformity continues to exist; (3) during any period of 24 months or less or during any period in which the vehicle has been driven 24,000 miles or less, whichever occurs first, the same nonconformity has been subject to repair, three or more times, at least one of which is during the lemon law rights period, and the nonconformity continues to exist; or (4) during any period of 24 months or less or during any period in which the vehicle has been driven 24,000 miles or less, whichever occurs first, the vehicle is out of service by reason of repair of one or more nonconformities for a cumulative total of 30 calendar days, at least 15 of them during the lemon law rights period.If less than 15 days remain under the lemon law rights period when the new motor vehicle is first brought in for diagnosis or repair, the lemon law rights period as regards the problem to be diagnosed or repaired shall be extended for a period of 90 days.

- c) For purposes of this article, the lemon law rights period regarding nonconformities on all new motor vehicles sold in this state shall be for 12 months following the purchase of the vehicle or for 12,000 miles following the purchase of the vehicle, whichever occurs first.

- d) This article shall not create and shall not give rise to any cause of action against and shall not impose any liability upon any new motor vehicle dealer or distributor except as provided in this Code section. No new motor vehicle dealer or distributor shall be held liable by the manufacturer or by the consumer for any collateral charges, damages, costs, purchase price refunds, or vehicle replacements, and manufacturers and consumers shall not have a cause of action against a new motor vehicle dealer or distributor under this article.A violation of any duty or responsibility imposed upon a new motor vehicle dealer or distributor under this article shall constitute a per se violation of Code Section 10-1-393; provided, however, that enforcement against such violations shall be by public enforcement by the administrator and shall not be enforceable through private enforcement under the provisions of Code Section 10-1-399, except that a knowing violation of Code Section 10-1-785 shall be enforceable through private enforcement under the provisions of Code Section 10-1-399.The provisions of Code Sections 11-2-602 through 11-2-609 shall not apply to the sale of a new motor vehicle if the consumer seeks to use the remedies provided for in this article.A consumer shall be deemed to have used the remedies provided for in this article when he or she completes, signs, and returns forms prescribed by the administrator for the submission of disputes to an informal dispute resolution settlement mechanism or to a panel, whichever occurs first. Such forms shall contain a conspicuous statement clearly advising the consumer of the rights the consumer is waiving by participating in the procedures under this article. A consumer may not use the remedies provided for in this article if the consumer has already sought to use the remedies provided for in Code Sections 11-2-602 through 11-2-609, unless the nonconformity did not exist or was not known at the time of using the remedies provided for in such Code sections. Manufacturers and consumers may not make new motor vehicle dealers or distributors parties to arbitration panel proceedings or any other proceedings under this article. The provisions of this article shall not impair any obligation under any manufacturer-dealer franchise agreement or manufacturer-distributor agreement; provided, however, that any provision of any manufacturer-dealer franchise agreement or manufacturer-distributor agreement which attempts to shift any duty, obligation, responsibility, or liability imposed upon a manufacturer by this article to a new motor vehicle dealer or distributor, either directly or indirectly, shall be void and unenforceable, except for any liability imposed upon a manufacturer by this article which is directly caused by the gross negligence of the dealer in attempting to repair the motor vehicle after such gross negligence has been determined by the hearing officer, as provided in Article 22 of this chapter, the "Georgia Motor Vehicle Franchise Practices Act."

**Georgia Lemon law 10-1-785**

- No manufacturer or other transferor shall knowingly resell, either at wholesale or retail, lease, transfer a title, or otherwise transfer, except to sell for scrap, any motor vehicle which has been determined to have a serious safety defect by reason of a determination, adjudication, or settlement decision pursuant to this article or similar statute of any other state, unless the serious safety defect has been corrected; the manufacturer warrants in writing upon the resale, transfer, or lease that the defect has been corrected; and the transferor provides the manufacturer's written warranty under this Code section to the consumer.

- After replacement or repurchase pursuant to this article of a motor vehicle with a nonconformity, other than a serious safety defect, which has not been corrected, the manufacturer shall notify the administrator, by certified mail, upon receipt of the manufacturer's motor vehicle.If such nonconformity is corrected, the manufacturer shall notify the administrator in the same manner of such correction.If the two events described in this subsection occur within 30 days of one another, both notices may be combined into the same notice. 

- Upon the resale, either at wholesale or retail, lease, transfer of title, or other transfer of a motor vehicle with a nonconformity, other than a serious safety defect, which has not been corrected and which was previously returned after a final determination, adjudication, or settlement under this article or under a similar statute of any other state, the manufacturer shall execute and deliver to the transferee before transfer to a consumer an instrument in writing setting forth information identifying the nonconformity in a manner to be specified by the administrator; the transferor shall deliver the instrument to the consumer before transfer.

- Upon the resale, either at wholesale or retail, lease, transfer of title, or other transfer of a motor vehicle found to have a nonconformity under this article which has been corrected, the manufacturer shall warrant in writing on forms prescribed by the administrator upon the transfer that the nonconformity has been corrected, and the manufacturer, its agent, the new motor vehicle dealer, or other transferor shall execute and deliver to the transferee before transfer an instrument in writing setting forth information identifying the nonconformity and indicating in a manner to be specified by the administrator that it has been corrected and providing an express manufacturer's warranty on the vehicle regarding the nonconformity for 12 months or 12,000 miles, whichever occurs first.

- For purposes of this Code section, the term "settlement" includes an agreement entered into between the manufacturer and the consumer that occurs after the dispute has been submitted to an informal dispute resolution settlement mechanism or has been deemed eligible by the administrator for arbitration before a panel.

**Georgia Lemon law 10-1-786**

- As provided in Code Section 10-1-794, the administrator may establish a new motor vehicle arbitration panel or panels to settle disputes between consumers and manufacturers as provided in this article. The panels shall not be affiliated with any manufacturer or new motor vehicle dealer and shall have available the services of persons with automotive technical expertise to assist in resolving disputes under this article.

- The administrator may adopt rules under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," for the uniform conduct of arbitrations by panels and by informal dispute resolution settlement mechanisms under this article, which rules may include, but not be limited to, the following:
  
  - Procedures regarding presentation of oral and written testimony, witnesses and evidence relevant to the dispute, cross-examination of witnesses, and representation by counsel.

- The administrator may adopt rules under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," to implement this article. Such rules may include uniform standards by which the panel and any informal dispute resolution settlement mechanism under Code Section 10-1-793 shall make determinations under this article, including but not limited to rules which may provide for:
  
  - Determining that a nonconformity exists; 
  
  - Determining that a reasonable number of attempts to repair a nonconformity have been undertaken; or
  
  - Determining that a manufacturer has failed to comply with Code Section 10-1-784.

**Georgia Lemon law 10-1-787**

- A consumer shall request arbitration under this article by submitting a request in writing to the administrator.Except as otherwise provided in this article, disputes under the lemon law rights period shall be eligible for arbitration.The administrator shall make a reasonable determination of the eligibility of the request for arbitration and may provide necessary information to the consumer regarding the consumer's rights and remedies under this article.The administrator may adopt rules under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," regarding the eligibility of requests for arbitration. The administrator shall assign a dispute he deems eligible to a panel.

- Manufacturers shall submit to arbitration under this article if the consumer's dispute is deemed eligible for arbitration by the administrator and by the panel.

- The new motor vehicle arbitration panel may reject for arbitration any dispute that it determines to be frivolous, fraudulent, filed in bad faith, res judicata, or beyond its authority.Any dispute deemed by the panel to be ineligible for arbitration due to insufficient evidence may be reconsidered by the panel upon the submission of other information or documents regarding the dispute that would allegedly qualify for relief under this article.Following a second review, the panel may reject the dispute for arbitration if evidence is still clearly insufficient to qualify the dispute for relief under this article.The administrator may adopt rules under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," governing rejection of disputes by a panel.A decision to reject any dispute for arbitration shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the consumer and the manufacturer.

- An arbitration panel shall award the remedies under Code Section 10-1-784 if it finds a nonconformity and that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to correct the nonconformity.The panel may in its discretion award attorney's fees and technical or expert witness costs to a consumer.

- It is an affirmative defense to any claim under this article that:

  - the alleged nonconformity does not substantially impair the use, value, or safety of the new motor vehicle to the consumer; or 
  - the alleged nonconformity is the result of abuse, neglect, or unauthorized modifications or alterations of the new motor vehicle.

- The panel's decision shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the consumer.The consumer must reject the decision in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the panel within 30 days of receipt of the panel's decision, or he or she shall be deemed to have accepted the panel's decision.The panel shall immediately notify the manufacturer by certified mail, return receipt requested, whether the consumer has accepted, rejected, or has been deemed to have accepted.

- If, at the end of the 40 calendar day period, neither compliance with nor a petition to appeal the panel's decision has occurred, the administrator may impose a fine of up to $1,000.00 per day until compliance occurs or until a maximum penalty of double the value of the vehicle or $100,000.00, whichever is less, accrues.If the manufacturer can provide clear and convincing evidence either that any delay or failure was beyond its control, or that any delay was acceptable to the consumer, the fine shall not be imposed.If the manufacturer fails to provide such evidence or fails to pay the fine, the administrator may initiate proceedings against the manufacturer for failure to pay any accrued fine and may initiate proceedings on behalf of the state to require specific performance of an arbitration decision under this article.The administrator shall deposit any fines in the state treasury.

**Georgia Lemon law 10-1-788**

- After the manufacturer has received notice of the consumer's acceptance or rejection, the consumer or the manufacturer shall have 40 days to request a trial de novo of the arbitration decision in superior court.

The first quarterly payments are due and payable on October 1, 1990, and shall be mailed by the dealer not later than October 10; thereafter, all payments are due and payable the first of the month in each quarter and shall be mailed by the dealer not later than the tenth day of such month.Moneys in the account shall be used for the purposes of this article, subject to appropriation. Funds in the new motor vehicle arbitration account shall be transferred to the general treasury at the end of each fiscal year. One dollar of each fee collected shall be retained by the dealer to cover administrative costs.

- At the end of each fiscal year, the administrator shall prepare a report listing the annual revenue generated and the expenses incurred in implementing and operating the arbitration program under this chapter.The Office of Planning and Budget shall provide the administrator with the figures regarding revenue generated.

- It is the intent of the General Assembly that any consumer who, on or after July 1, 1990, but prior to January 1, 1991, pays or should have paid the fee designated in this Code section shall be entitled to utilize the remedies provided in Code Sections 10-1-786, 10-1-787, and 10-1-788 in addition to any other remedies which exist in law or in equity regarding defective automobiles, notwithstanding the effective dates of this article or the effective dates of any provisions of this article.

**Georgia Lemon law 10-1-790**

A violation of this article, or any failure of any person, including a manufacturer or its agents, to honor any express warranty, automotive or otherwise, issued by that person, regardless of whether or not such warranty was purchased as a separate item by the consumer and regardless of whether or not any dispute under the warranty is deemed eligible for arbitration under this article, shall constitute an unfair and deceptive act or practice and a consumer transaction under Part 2 of Article 15 of this chapter.In determining whether there is an unfair and deceptive act or practice under this Code section, the principles in this article regarding a reasonable number of attempts may serve as guidelines. All public and private remedies provided under Part 2 of Article 15 of this chapter shall be available to enforce this article, subject to the affirmative defenses provided in Code Section 10-1-787, and except as provided in Code Section 10-1-784.

**Georgia Lemon law 10-1-791**

Any agreement entered into by a consumer for the purchase of a new motor vehicle that waives, limits, or disclaims the rights set forth in this article shall be void as contrary to public policy. Said rights shall extend to a subsequent transferee of a new motor vehicle.

**Georgia Lemon law 10-1-792**

Nothing in this article shall limit anyone from pursuing other rights or remedies under any other law, except as otherwise provided in this article.

**Georgia Lemon law 10-1-793**

- If a manufacturer has established an informal dispute resolution settlement mechanism in this state and is operating in accordance with rules promulgated by the administrator under this article, and the administrator has certified that the informal dispute resolution settlement procedure complies with and is operating in accordance with such rules, a consumer must submit a dispute under this article to the informal dispute resolution settlement procedure before submitting it to the new motor vehicle arbitration panel.The administrator may adopt rules consistent with this article under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," regarding the informal dispute resolution settlement mechanisms, including but not limited to the composition, function, training, procedures, and conduct of informal dispute resolution settlement mechanisms and including eligibility requirements and procedures for appeals to a panel.Such rules must be complied with prior to certification.

- Informal dispute resolution settlement mechanisms shall take into account the principles contained in this article and in any rules promulgated thereunder and shall take into account all legal and equitable factors germane to a fair and just decision.A decision shall include any remedies appropriate under the circumstances, including repair, replacement, refund, reimbursement for collateral and incidental charges, and compensation for loss of value.For purposes of this Code section, the phrase: "Take into account the principles contained in this article" means to be aware of the provisions of this article, to understand how they might apply to the circumstances of the particular dispute, and to apply them if it is appropriate and fair to both parties to do so.

- At any time the administrator has reason to believe that a certified informal dispute resolution settlement mechanism is not acting in conformity with this article or with rules promulgated thereunder, he may initiate proceedings under Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act," to revoke the certification of the informal dispute resolution settlement mechanism.An informal dispute resolution settlement mechanism shall keep such records as prescribed by the administrator in rules under this article and shall submit without notice to inspection and copying of these records by the administrator's employees.Expenses of any copying shall be borne by the informal dispute resolution settlement mechanism.

**Georgia Lemon law 10-1-794**

The new motor vehicle arbitration panel or panels shall begin operating on January 2, 1991.The administrator in his discretion may establish and operate the panel or panels under any of the following procedures, provided that disputes filed during the same time period shall not be handled under different procedures: (1) contracting with private or public entities to conduct arbitrations under the procedures and standards in this article, (2) appointing private citizens to serve on a panel or panels, or (3) hiring temporary or permanent employees to serve on the panel or panels.
