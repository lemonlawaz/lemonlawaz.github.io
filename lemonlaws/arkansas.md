**Arkansas Title 4, Chapter 90, Sections 401-417**

**Arkansas Lemon Law 4-90-401.** Title.
This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Arkansas New Motor Vehicle Quality Assurance Act". 

**History. Acts 1993, No. 285, ? 1; 1993, No. 297, ? 1.**

**Arkansas Lemon Law 4-90-402.** Legislative determinations and intent.

The Arkansas General Assembly recognizes that a motor vehicle is a major consumer acquisition and that a defective motor vehicle undoubtedly creates a hardship for the consumer. The Arkansas General Assembly further recognizes that a duly franchised motor vehicle dealer is an authorized service agent of the manufacturer. It is the intent of the Arkansas General Assembly that a good faith motor vehicle warranty complaint by a consumer be resolved by the manufacturer within a specified period of time. It is further the intent of the Arkansas General Assembly to provide the statutory procedures whereby a consumer may receive a replacement motor vehicle, or a full refund, for a motor vehicle which cannot be brought into conformity with the warranty provided for in this subchapter. However, nothing in this subchapter shall in any way limit the rights or remedies which are otherwise available to a consumer under any other law.

**History. Acts 1993, No. 285, ? 2; 1993, No. 297, ? 2.**

**Arkansas Lemon Law 4-90-405.** Required warranty repairs.

If a motor vehicle does not conform to the warranty and the consumer reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, its agent, or authorized dealer during the motor vehicle quality assurance period, the manufacturer, its agent, or authorized dealer shall make such repairs as are necessary to correct the nonconformity, even if the repairs are made after the expiration of the term of protection.

**Arkansas Lemon Law 4-90-406.** Failure to make required repairs.

(a) <br>
  1.

  2. The manufacturer shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of the notification, notify and provide the consumer with the opportunity to have the vehicle repaired at a reasonably accessible repair facility, and, after delivery of the vehicle to the designated repair facility by the consumer, the manufacturer shall, within ten (10) days, conform the motor vehicle to the warranty. <br>
  3. If the manufacturer fails to notify and provide the consumer with the opportunity to have the vehicle repaired at a reasonably accessible repair facility or fails to perform the repairs within the time periods prescribed in this subsection, the requirement that the manufacturer be given a final attempt to cure the nonconformity does not apply and a non rebuttable presumption of a reasonable number of attempts to repair arises.

  >i. At the time of its receipt of payment of a reasonable offset for use by the consumer, replace the motor vehicle with a replacement motor vehicle acceptable to the consumer; or

  2. (A) The consumer shall have an unconditional right to choose a refund rather than a replacement. (B) At the time of such refund or replacement, the consumer, lienholder, or lessor shall furnish to the manufacturer clear title to and possession of the motor vehicle. <br>
  3. The amount of reasonable offset for use by the consumer shall be determined by multiplying the actual price of the new motor vehicle paid or payable by the consumer, including any charges for transportation and manufacturer-installed or agent-installed options, by a fraction having as its denominator one hundred twenty thousand (120,000) and having as its numerator the number of miles traveled by the new motor vehicle prior to the time the buyer first delivered the vehicle to the manufacturer, its agent, or authorized dealer for correction of the problem that gave rise to the nonconformity.

**History. Acts 1993, No. 285, ? 6; 1993, No. 297, ? 6; 1995, No. 302, ? 3.**

(c) The burden is on the manufacturer to show that the reason for an extension under subsection (b) of this section was the direct cause for the failure of the manufacturer, its agent, or authorized dealer to cure any nonconformity during the time of the event.
