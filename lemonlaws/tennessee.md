# Tennessee Lemon Law 55-24-202. Nonconforming vehicles - Reports - Repairs.

- If a new motor vehicle does not conform to all applicable express warranties and the consumer reports the nonconformity, defect or condition to the manufacturer, its agent or its authorized dealer during the term of protection, the manufacturer, its agent or its authorized dealer shall correct the nonconformity, defect or condition at no charge to the consumer, notwithstanding the fact that such repairs are made after the expiration of such term. Any corrections or attempted corrections undertaken by an authorized dealer under the provisions of this section shall be treated as warranty work and billed by the dealer to the manufacturer in the same manner as other work under warranty is billed.

[Acts 1986, ch. 857, ? 2.]


# Tennessee Lemon Law 55-24-203. Replacement or repair of vehicles - Refunds - Refinancing agreements - Defenses.

- The manufacturer must replace the motor vehicle with a comparable motor vehicle or accept return of the vehicle from the consumer and refund to the consumer the full purchase price if: 

    - The nonconformity, defect or condition substantially impairs the motor vehicle; and

    - The manufacturer, its agent or authorized dealer is unable to conform the motor vehicle to any applicable express warranty after a reasonable number of attempts.

    - "Full purchase price" means the actual cost paid by the consumer, including all collateral charges, less a reasonable allowance for use; and

    - (A) "Reasonable allowance for use" means that amount directly attributable to use by a consumer prior to such consumer's first report of the nonconformity to the manufacturer, agent or dealer and during any subsequent period when the vehicle is not out of service by reason of repair, plus a reasonable amount for any damage not attributable to normal wear.

- A reasonable allowance for use shall not exceed one half (1/2) of the amount allowed per mile by the internal revenue service, as provided by regulation, revenue procedure or revenue ruling promulgated pursuant to ? 162 of the Internal Revenue Code, for use of a personal vehicle for business purposes, plus an amount to account for any loss to the fair market value of the vehicle resulting from damage beyond normal wear and tear, unless the damage resulted from nonconformity to an express warranty.

- Refunds shall be made to the consumer, and lienholder, if any, as their interests appear. The provisions of this section shall not affect the interests of a lienholder; unless the lienholder consents to the replacement of the lien with a corresponding lien on the vehicle accepted by the consumer in exchange for the vehicle having a nonconformity, the lienholder shall be paid in full the amount due on the lien, including interest and other charges, before an exchange of automobiles or a refund to the consumer is made.

- In instances where a vehicle which was financed by the manufacturer or its subsidiary or agent is replaced under the provisions of this section, the manufacturer, subsidiary or agent shall not require the consumer to enter into any refinancing agreement which would create any financial obligations upon such consumer beyond those imposed by the original financing agreement.

- It shall be an affirmative defense to any claim under this part: 

    - That an alleged nonconformity does not substantially impair a motor vehicle; or
    - That a nonconformity is the result of abuse, neglect or unauthorized modifications or alterations of a motor vehicle by a consumer.

# Tennessee Lemon Law 55-24-205. Presumptions - Term of protection - Notice to manufacturer.

It shall be presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to conform a motor vehicle to the applicable express warranties, if: 

    - The same nonconformity has been subject to repair four (4) or more times by the manufacturer or its agents or authorized dealers, but such nonconformity continues to exist; or

    - The vehicle is out of service by reason of repair for a cumulative total of thirty (30) or more calendar days during the term of protection.

- The term of protection and such thirty-day period shall be extended by any period of time during which repair services are not available to the consumer because of a war, invasion, strike or fire, flood or other natural disaster.

- It shall be the responsibility of the consumer, or the representative of the consumer, prior to proceeding under the provisions of ? 55-24-203, to give written notification by certified mail directly to the manufacturer of the need for the correction or repair of the nonconformity. If the address of the manufacturer is not readily available to the consumer in the owner's manual or manufacturer's warranty received by the consumer at the time of purchase of the motor vehicle, such written notification shall be mailed to an authorized dealer. The authorized dealer shall upon receipt forward such notification to the manufacturer. If, at the time such notice is given, either of the conditions set forth in subsection (a) already exists, the manufacturer shall be given an additional opportunity after receipt of the notification, not to exceed ten (10) days, to correct or repair the nonconformity.

- Any agreement entered into by a consumer for, or in connection with, the purchase or lease of a new motor vehicle which waives, limits or disclaims the rights set forth in this part shall be void as contrary to public policy.
