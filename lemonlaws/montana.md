- "**Consumer**" means the purchaser, other than for purposes of resale, of a motor vehicle that has not been brought into nonconformity as the result of abuse, neglect, or unauthorized modifications or alterations by the purchaser, any person to whom the motor vehicle is transferred during the duration of an express warranty applicable to the motor vehicle, or any other person entitled by the terms of the warranty to the benefits of its provisions.

- "**Incidental damage**" means incidental and consequential damage as defined in 30-2-715.

- "**Manufacturer**" has the meaning applied to that word in 61-4-201. 

- "**Motor vehicle**" means a vehicle, including the nonresidential portion of a motor home as defined in 61-1-130, propelled by its own power, designed primarily to transport persons or property upon the public highways, and sold in this state.

Motor vehicle does not include components, systems, fixtures, appliances, furnishings, accessories, and features that are designed, used, and maintained primarily for residential purposes.

The reasonable allowance for use shall be computed by multiplying the total contract price of the vehicle by a fraction having as its denominator 100,000 and having as its numerator the number of miles that the vehicle traveled prior to the manufacturer's acceptance of its return. 

- "**Warranty period**" means the period ending 2 years after the date of the original delivery to the consumer of a new motor vehicle or during the first 18,000 miles of operation, whichever is earlier.

**Montana Lemon Law 61-4-502.** Notice -- warranty enforceable after warranty period -- when.

- If a consumer notifies in writing the manufacturer or its agent during the warranty period that a new motor vehicle does not conform to all applicable express warranties, the repairs necessary to conform the new motor vehicle to the express warranties shall be made by or at the expense of the warrantor, regardless of the expiration of the warranty period after notification of nonconformity is given by the consumer. 

- The warranty period of an express warranty is extended to equal the time that repair services are not available because of war or invasion or because of strike or fire, flood, or other natural disaster. The presumption provided herein may not apply against a manufacturer who has not received prior written notification from or on behalf of the consumer and has not had an opportunity to cure the alleged defect.

- The manufacturer must clearly and conspicuously disclose to the consumer in the warranty or owner's manual that written notification of a nonconformity is required before a consumer may be eligible for a refund or replacement of the vehicle. The manufacturer must include with the warranty or owner's manual the name and address where the written notification must be sent.

- If after a reasonable number of attempts the manufacturer or its agent or authorized dealer is unable, during the warranty period, to conform the new motor vehicle to any applicable express warranty by repairing or correcting any defect or condition that substantially impairs the use and market value or safety of the motor vehicle to the consumer, the manufacturer shall replace it with a new motor vehicle of the same model and style and of equal value, unless for reasons of lack of availability such replacement is impossible, in which case the manufacturer shall replace it with a vehicle of comparable market value. 

- As an alternative to replacement, the manufacturer may accept return of the new motor vehicle from the consumer upon refund to him of the full purchase price, plus reasonable collateral charges and incidental damages, less a reasonable allowance for the consumer's use of the motor vehicle. The refund shall be paid to the consumer and to a lienholder, if any, in proportion to their interests.
