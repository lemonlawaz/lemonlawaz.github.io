Washington Lemon law Title 19 Chapter 118 RCW - MOTOR VEHICLE WARRANTIES 

# Washington Lemon law RCW 19.118.005 

Legislative intent

- The legislature recognizes that a new motor vehicle is a major consumer purchase and that a defective motor vehicle is likely to create hardship for, or may cause injury to, the consumer. The legislature further recognizes that good cooperation and communication between a manufacturer and a new motor vehicle dealer will considerably increase the likelihood that a new motor vehicle will be repaired within a reasonable number of attempts. It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that the consumer is made aware of his or her rights under this chapter and is not refused information, documents, or service that would otherwise obstruct the exercise of his or her rights.

- In enacting these comprehensive measures, it is the intent of the legislature to create the proper blend of private and public remedies necessary to enforce this chapter, such that a manufacturer will be sufficiently induced to take necessary steps to improve quality control at the time of production or provide better warranty service for the new motor vehicles that it sells in this state.

[1987 c 344 ? 1.]

# Washington Lemon law RCW 19.118.010 

Motor vehicle manufacturers - Express warranties - Service and repair facilities.

Every manufacturer of motor vehicles sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty shall maintain in this state sufficient service and repair facilities reasonably close to all areas in which its motor vehicles are sold to carry out the terms of the warranties or designate and authorize in this state as service and repair facilities independent repair or service facilities reasonably close to all areas in which its motor vehicles are sold to carry out the terms of the warranties. As a means of complying with this section, a manufacturer may enter into warranty service contracts with independent service and repair facilities.

Replacement or repurchase of nonconforming new motor vehicle--Reasonable number of attempts--Liabilities and rights of parties--Application of consumer protection act.

- If the manufacturer, its agent, or the new motor vehicle dealer is unable to conform the new motor vehicle to the warranty by repairing or correcting any nonconformity after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer, within forty calendar days of a consumer's written request to the manufacturer's corporate, dispute resolution, zone, or regional office address shall, at the option of the consumer, replace or repurchase the new motor vehicle. 

    - The replacement motor vehicle shall be identical or reasonably equivalent to the motor vehicle to be replaced as the motor vehicle to be replaced existed at the time of original purchase or lease, including any service contract, undercoating, rustproofing, and factory or dealer installed options. Where the manufacturer supplies a replacement motor vehicle, the manufacturer shall be responsible for sales tax, license, registration fees, and refund of any incidental costs. Compensation for a reasonable offset for use shall be paid by the consumer to the manufacturer in the event that the consumer accepts a replacement motor vehicle.

    -  When repurchasing the new motor vehicle, the manufacturer shall refund to the consumer the purchase price, all collateral charges, and incidental costs, less a reasonable offset for use. When repurchasing the new motor vehicle, in the instance of a lease, the manufacturer shall refund to the consumer all payments made by the consumer under the lease including but not limited to all lease payments, trade-in value or inception payment, security deposit, all collateral charges and incidental costs less a reasonable offset for use. The manufacturer shall make such payment to the lessor and/or lienholder of record as necessary to obtain clear title to the motor vehicle and upon the lessor's and/ or lienholder's receipt of that payment and payment by the consumer of any late payment charges, the consumer shall be relieved of any future obligation to the lessor and/or lienholder.

    - The reasonable offset for use shall be computed by multiplying the number of miles that the vehicle traveled directly attributable to use by the consumer times the purchase price, and dividing the product by one hundred twenty thousand. Where the consumer is a second or subsequent purchaser, lessee, or transferee of the motor vehicle and the consumer selects repurchase of the motor vehicle, "the number of miles that the vehicle traveled" shall be calculated from the date of purchase or lease by the consumer. Where the consumer is a second or subsequent purchaser, lessee, or transferee of the motor vehicle and the consumer selects replacement of the motor vehicle, "the number of miles that the vehicle traveled" shall be calculated from the original purchase, lease, or in-service date.

- Reasonable number of attempts shall be deemed to have been undertaken by the manufacturer, its agent, or the new motor vehicle dealer to conform the new motor vehicle to the warranty within the warranty period, if: 

    - The same serious safety defect has been subject to diagnosis or repair two or more times, at least one of which is during the period of coverage of the applicable manufacturer's written warranty, and the serious safety defect continues to exist;
    
    - the same nonconformity has been subject to diagnosis or repair four or more times, at least one of which is during the period of coverage of the applicable manufacturer's written warranty, and the nonconformity continues to exist; or

    - the vehicle is out-of-service by reason of diagnosis or repair of one or more nonconformities for a cumulative total of thirty calendar days, at least fifteen of them during the period of the applicable manufacturer's written warranty. For purposes of this subsection, the manufacturer's written warranty shall be at least one year after the date of the original delivery to the consumer of the vehicle or the first twelve thousand miles of operation, whichever occurs first.

- No new motor vehicle dealer may be held liable by the manufacturer for any collateral charges, incidental costs, purchase price refunds, or vehicle replacements. Manufacturers shall not have a cause of action against dealers under this chapter. Consumers shall not have a cause of action against dealers under this chapter, but a violation of any responsibilities imposed upon dealers under this chapter is a per se violation of chapter 19.86 RCW. Consumers may pursue rights and remedies against dealers under any other law, including chapters 46.70 and 46.71 RCW. Manufacturers and consumers may not make dealers parties to arbitration board proceedings under this chapter.

- The attorney general shall adopt rules for the uniform conduct of the arbitrations by the boards whether conducted by a private entity or by the attorney general pursuant to RCW 19.118.160, which rules shall include but not be limited to the following procedures: 
    
    - At all arbitration proceedings, the parties are entitled to present oral and written testimony, to present witnesses and evidence relevant to the dispute, to cross-examine witnesses, and to be represented by counsel.

    - A dealer, manufacturer, or other persons shall produce records and documents requested by a party which are reasonably related to the dispute. If a dealer, manufacturer, or other person refuses to comply with such a request, a party may present a request to the board for the attorney general to issue a subpoena on behalf of the board. 

    The subpoena shall be issued only for the production of records and documents which the board has determined are reasonably related to the dispute, including but not limited to documents described in RCW 19.118.031 (4) or (5). 

    If a party fails to comply with the subpoena, the arbitrator may at the outset of the arbitration hearing impose any of the following sanctions:

        - Find that the matters which were the subject of the subpoena, or any other designated facts, shall be taken to be established for purposes of the hearing in accordance with the claim of the party which requested the subpoena;

        - refuse to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose the designated claims or defenses, or prohibit that party from introducing designated matters into evidence;

        - strike claims or defenses, or parts thereof; or

        - render a decision by default against the disobedient party.

    If a nonparty fails to comply with a subpoena and upon an arbitrator finding that without such compliance there is insufficient evidence to render a decision in the dispute, the attorney general shall enforce such subpoena in superior court and the arbitrator shall continue the arbitration hearing until such time as the nonparty complies with the subpoena or the subpoena is quashed.

    - A party may obtain written affidavits from employees and agents of a dealer, a manufacturer or other party, or from other potential witnesses, and may submit such affidavits for consideration by the board.

    - Records of the board proceedings shall be open to the public. The hearings shall be open to the public to the extent practicable.

    - Where the board proceedings are conducted by one or more private entities, a single arbitrator may be designated to preside at such proceedings.

- The attorney general shall submit biennial reports of the information in this section to the senate and house of representatives committees on commerce and labor, with the first report due January 1, 1990.

- The attorney general shall adopt rules to implement this chapter. Such rules shall include uniform standards by which the boards shall make determinations under this chapter, including but not limited to rules which provide: 

    - A board shall find that a nonconformity exists if it determines that the consumer's new motor vehicle has a defect, serious safety defect, or condition that substantially impairs the use, value, or safety of the vehicle.

    - A board shall find that a reasonable number of attempts to repair a nonconformity have been undertaken if:

        - The same serious safety defect has been subject to diagnosis or repair two or more times, at least one of which is during the period of coverage of the applicable manufacturer's written warranty, and the serious safety defect continues to exist;
        
        - the same nonconformity has been subject to diagnosis or repair four or more times, at least one of which is during the period of coverage of the applicable manufacturer's written warranty, and the nonconformity continues to exist; or

For purposes of this subsection, the manufacturer's written warranty shall be at least one year after the date of the original delivery to the consumer of the vehicle or the first twelve thousand miles of operation, whichever occurs first.

    - A board shall find that a manufacturer has failed to comply with RCW 19.118.041 if it finds that the manufacturer, its agent, or the new motor vehicle dealer has failed to correct a nonconformity after a reasonable number of attempts and the manufacturer has failed, within forty days of the consumer's written request, to repurchase the vehicle or replace the vehicle with a vehicle identical or reasonably equivalent to the vehicle being replaced.

- The attorney general shall provide consumers with information regarding the procedures and remedies under this chapter.

Request for arbitration - Eligibility - Rejection - Manufacturer's response - Remedies - Defenses - Acceptance or appeal.

- A consumer may request arbitration under this chapter by submitting the request to the attorney general. Within ten days after receipt of an arbitration request, the attorney general shall make a reasonable determination of the cause of the request for arbitration and provide necessary information to the consumer regarding the consumer's rights and remedies under this chapter. The attorney general shall assign the dispute to a board, except that if it clearly appears from the materials submitted by the consumer that the dispute is not eligible for arbitration, the attorney general may refuse to assign the dispute and shall explain any required procedures to the consumer.

- Manufacturers shall submit to arbitration if such arbitration is requested by the consumer within thirty months from the date of the original delivery of the new motor vehicle to a consumer at retail and if the consumer's dispute is deemed eligible for arbitration by the board.

- The new motor vehicle arbitration board may reject for arbitration any dispute that it determines to be frivolous, fraudulent, filed in bad faith, res judicata or beyond its authority. Any dispute deemed by the board to be ineligible for arbitration due to insufficient evidence may be reconsidered by the board upon the submission of other information or documents regarding the dispute that would allegedly qualify for relief under this chapter. Following a second review, the board may reject the dispute for arbitration if evidence is still clearly insufficient to qualify the dispute for relief under this chapter. A rejection by the board is subject to review by the attorney general or may be appealed under RCW 19.118.100. 

A decision to reject any dispute for arbitration shall be sent by certified mail to the consumer and the manufacturer, and shall contain a brief explanation as to the reason therefor.

- The manufacturer shall complete a written manufacturer response to the consumer's request for arbitration. The manufacturer shall provide a response to the consumer and the board within ten calendar days from the date of the manufacturer's receipt of the board's notice of acceptance of a dispute for arbitration. The manufacturer response shall include all issues and affirmative defenses related to the nonconformities identified in the consumer's request for arbitration that the manufacturer intends to raise at the arbitration hearing.

- The arbitration board shall award the remedies under RCW 19.118.041 if it finds a nonconformity and that a reasonable number of attempts have been undertaken to correct the nonconformity. The board shall award reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the consumer where the manufacturer has been directly represented by counsel:

    - In dealings with the consumer in response to a request to repurchase or replace under RCW 19.118.041;
    - in settlement negotiations;
    - in preparation of the manufacturer's statement; or
    - at an arbitration board hearing or other board proceeding.

- It is an affirmative defense to any claim under this chapter that: 

    - The alleged nonconformity does not substantially impair the use, value, or safety of the new motor vehicle; or
    - the alleged nonconformity is the result of abuse, neglect, or unauthorized modifications or alterations of the new motor vehicle.

- The board shall have forty-five calendar days from the date the board receives the consumer's request for arbitration to hear the dispute. If the board determines that additional information is necessary, the board may continue the arbitration proceeding on a subsequent date within ten calendar days of the initial hearing. The board shall decide the dispute within sixty calendar days from the date the board receives the consumer's request for arbitration. 

The decision of the board shall be delivered by certified mail or personal service to the consumer and the manufacturer, and shall contain a written finding of whether the new motor vehicle meets the standards set forth under this chapter.

- The consumer may accept the arbitration board decision or appeal to superior court, pursuant to RCW 19.118.100. Upon acceptance by the consumer, the arbitration board decision shall become final. The consumer shall send written notification of acceptance or rejection to the arbitration board within sixty days of receiving the decision and the arbitration board shall immediately deliver a copy of the consumer's acceptance to the manufacturer by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service. Failure of the consumer to respond to the arbitration board within sixty calendar days of receiving the decision shall be considered a rejection of the decision by the consumer. The consumer shall have one hundred twenty calendar days from the date of rejection to file a petition of appeal in superior court. At the time the petition of appeal is filed, the consumer shall deliver, by certified mail or personal service, a conformed copy of such petition to the attorney general.

- Upon receipt of the consumer's acceptance, the manufacturer shall have forty calendar days to comply with the arbitration board decision or thirty calendar days to file a petition of appeal in superior court. At the time the petition of appeal is filed, the manufacturer shall deliver, by certified mail or personal service, a conformed copy of such petition to the attorney general. If the attorney general receives no notice of petition of appeal after forty calendar days, the attorney general shall contact the consumer to verify compliance.

Any insurance claims or settlement proceeds for repair of damage to the vehicle due to fire, theft, vandalism, or collision must be assigned to the manufacturer or, at the consumer's option, the repair must be completed before return of the vehicle to the manufacturer. 

    - The consumer may not remove any equipment or option that was included in the original purchase or lease of the vehicle or that is otherwise included in the repurchase or replacement award. In removing any equipment not included in the original purchase or lease, the consumer shall exercise reasonable care to avoid further damage to the vehicle but is not required to return the vehicle to original condition.

    - At the time of compliance with an arbitration board decision that awards repurchase, the manufacturer shall make full payment to the consumers and either the lessor or lienholder, or both, or provide verification to the consumer of prior payment to either the lessor or lienholder, or both. 


    At the time of compliance with an arbitration board decision that awards replacement, the manufacturer shall provide the replacement vehicle together with any refund of incidental costs.

    - At any time before compliance a party may request the board to resolve disputes regarding compliance with the arbitration board decision including but not limited to time and place for compliance, condition of the vehicle to be returned, clarification or recalculation of refund amounts under the award, or a determination if an offered vehicle is reasonably equivalent to the vehicle being replaced. In resolving compliance disputes the board may not review, alter, or otherwise change the findings of a decision or extend the time for compliance beyond the time necessary for the board to resolve the dispute.

    - Failure of the consumer to make the vehicle available within sixty calendar days in response to a manufacturer's unconditional tender of compliance is considered a rejection of the arbitration decision by the consumer, except as provided in (c) of this subsection or subsection (2) of this section.

- If, at the end of the forty calendar day period, neither compliance with nor a petition to appeal the board's decision has occurred, the attorney general may impose a fine of up to one thousand dollars per day until compliance occurs or a maximum penalty of one hundred thousand dollars accrues unless the manufacturer can provide clear and convincing evidence that any delay or failure was beyond its control or was acceptable to the consumer as evidenced by a written statement signed by the consumer. If the manufacturer fails to provide the evidence or fails to pay the fine, the attorney general may initiate proceedings against the manufacturer for failure to pay any fine that accrues until compliance with the board's decision occurs or the maximum penalty of one hundred thousand dollars results. If the attorney general prevails in an enforcement action regarding any fine imposed under this subsection, the attorney general is entitled to reasonable costs and attorneys' fees. Fines and recovered costs and fees shall be returned to the new motor vehicle arbitration account.

Trial de novo - Posting security - Recovery.

- The consumer or the manufacturer may request a trial de novo of the arbitration decision, including a rejection, in superior court.
- If the manufacturer appeals, the court may require the manufacturer to post security for the consumer's financial loss due to the passage of time for review.
- If the consumer prevails, recovery shall include the monetary value of the award, attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the superior court action, and, if the board awarded the consumer replacement or repurchase of the vehicle and the manufacturer did not comply, continuing damages in the amount of twenty-five dollars per day for all days beyond the forty calendar day period following the manufacturer's receipt of the consumer's acceptance of the board's decision in which the manufacturer did not provide the consumer with the free use of a comparable loaner replacement motor vehicle. If it is determined by the court that the party that appealed acted without good cause in bringing the appeal or brought the appeal solely for the purpose of harassment, the court may triple, but at least shall double, the amount of the total award.
