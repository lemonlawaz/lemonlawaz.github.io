The state-specific files are located in the `lemonlaws` folder. Any file named "index" is the main file of that given section. So for instance the `index.md` file on the list above is the home page. In the `lemonlaws` folder, the `index.md` file is the main file for states.

### View a file

When you view a file you'll get a page that looks like this:

When you're done editing, click the "Commit Changes" button at the bottom of the page:
