#Am I the Victim of Fraud?

Fraud can happen to anyone! Fraud is often committed by an automobile dealership misrepresenting or failing to disclose the true condition of a vehicle that it sells.

#Some different types of fraud are:

#ODOMETER FRAUD

Is the mileage that is shown on your odometer different than the actual mileage on the vehicle? This can be determined by running a CARFAX report.

#PRIOR ACCIDENT

Have you found out that your vehicle was wrecked before you purchased it, and was this contrary to representations made by the dealership before the sale? 

#OTHER MISREPRESENTATIONS

Have you found out that your vehicle was previously a rental car and that this fact was not disclosed? Or did you find out that your vehicle has a salvaged title? If so, you may be the victim of fraud!
