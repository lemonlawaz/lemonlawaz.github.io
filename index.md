Pryor, Ramirez & Amar, LLC is dedicated to providing the highest quality legal services and protection to consumers like you who have had the misfortune of purchasing defective "Lemon" vehicles through the use of State and federal Lemon Laws.* Since 2006 our Firm has helped 1000's of consumers saddled with lemons obtain cash compensation, replacement vehicles, or refunds for their defective vehicles; **without any out of pocket costs.**

With the diligent representation of our experienced attorneys, you are empowered to obtain recovery from motor vehicle companies under federal and State Lemon Laws. Often **such recovery can be obtained out of court with minimal time commitment** (see our [FAQs page](/faqs.html)) and without any costs.  After all, you deserve better.  You deserve the new car value you paid for!

Have you purchased a **2011 or newer model year vehicle** and feel that you unwittingly bought a "Lemon," or did not get the new car value you truly deserve? Are you tired of wondering "what's going to go wrong with my car next" because one thing after another keeps breaking in it?  Have you had enough of hoping that, "this time will be it, my car will finally be fixed properly" and then it isn't?  
You don't have to keep putting up with not having your new car day after day while the repair shop tries to fix it or to go back and forth to dealerships to get repairs that never seem to end.  The Lemon Law and other warranty laws were written to help people in your situation by requiring that the car company either buyback or replace your car or compensate you and also pay attorneys' fees.  We will use these laws to help you and to charge the car companies for our fees.  So if you've experienced enough frustration with your Lemon and are ready to get the new car value you deserve then review our Lemon Law page and submit your car information for a [FREE CASE REVIEW](/lemon-law-free-case-review.html).*
